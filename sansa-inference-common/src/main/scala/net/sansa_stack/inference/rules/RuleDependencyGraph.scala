/**
  * Given a set of rules R, a rule dependency graph (RDG) is a directed graph G = (V, E) such that
  * <ol>
  * <li>each vertex in V represents a rule r_i from R and </li>
  * <li>each edge (r_i, r_j) in E denotes the dependency between them </li>
  * </ol>
  *
  * The dependency between two rules r_i and r_j, denoted as r_i -> r_j resp. "r_i depends on r_j"
  * indicates that the result r_j is used as input of r_i. In particular, that means we use the
  * same direction in the graph although one would expect to have an edge from the rule r_j producing the data
  * to the rule r_i consuming the data.
